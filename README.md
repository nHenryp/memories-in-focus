Our project is called Memories in focus.

It is a app focsing on capturing images with a timeless touch, It is a  photo gallery of stunning film photography, showcasing you your pictures and others.  As a logged in user you can view the full gallery including others users. Create, edit, update and delete your own pieces and you also have the ability to comment on photos.

All in all working as a group was fun but with a few challenges such as  as implementing specific functions such as the carousal, delegating and planning. 

To enhance the app there are many things we would like to add such as enhancing the css of each page by making use of templates.  We would have also liked to create albums and also create the functionality to like photos.
